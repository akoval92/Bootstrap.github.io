                The largest portion of my professional life has been spent in the Scripps Green Rapid Response Laboratory. My career has been centered around one of the most despised professions EVER…….
                What is it? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlebotomy">Phlebotomy</a>! Otherwise known as taking your blood. It’s definitely a unique profession that has many people shutter just at the explanation but it was a great choice for me. Before obtaining my CPT1 license, I worked at a retail furniture store, West Elm. I began as a cashier but once they figured out I couldn’t (wouldn’t) upsell, they asked if I’d like to try the stockroom where I stayed for 2 years. Before West Elm I worked at Subway between ages 16 and 17 where I became a shift leader. Although my official work experience began at 16, I had my first job at 13 at a daycare for a small summer job and another at 15 for a small clothing boutique.  I’ve gained many skills from each position I’ve held and I’m excited to venture into a whole new aspect of the professional world.

My wonderful husband was my high school crush. We were in the same history class and eventually figured out we were both less than model students, which made us friends. We eventually discovered that we went to the same middle school for 6th grade (where we didn’t know each other). Also, we both left the traditional high school we met at and ended up at the same charter school (where we only attended twice a week) but attended different days of the week. We eventually reconnected at 22 and have built the best existence I could have imagined over the last 4 years. We welcomed our beautiful daughter into the world November 1st ,2018. I love my current career but I know if I want to give my daughter the best life possible, I need to make a change. </div>
